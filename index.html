  <p>Hello there! We could really use your help. A storm came in and everything in the garden was blown away, creatures and all! On the next page you will find a board full of squares. Click on them to reveal a picture of something that belongs in the garden.<br/>If you can match all the pictures up, the garden will be in tip-top shape again!<br/>Click "Play" to begin, good luck!</p>
